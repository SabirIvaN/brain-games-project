## Description

This is a small command line game involving basic arithmetical games which last for 3 rounds in case of successfully answering the questions.
This is an educational project with the main goal to get familiar with setting up development environment in a PHP project.

## Installation

In order to install the game run:

```
composer global require sabirivan/braingames:dev-master
```

## Run the game
Start the game by calling the game module. You can run the following modules:
* brain-even;
* brain-calc;
* brain-gcd;
* brain-progression;
* brain-prime.

## Demonstration modules:
